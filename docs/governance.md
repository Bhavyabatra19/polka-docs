# Understanding Governance in Polkadot

Polkadot uses a decentralized governance model called OpenGov. Here's what you need to know:

## üß† Key Concepts

### Tracks
Each proposal is submitted under a specific ‚Äútrack‚Äù:
- Root
- Treasury
- Fellowship
- Referendum

Each track has different thresholds and timelines.

### Conviction Voting
Vote strength increases based on how long you lock your tokens:
- 1x = no lock
- 2x = 1 week
- 3x = 2 weeks
- ... up to 6x = 32 weeks

### Delegation
Delegate your voting power to others, with control over specific tracks.

### Fellowship
A community of expert contributors that help govern the technical evolution of Polkadot.
